- Refreshing basic HTML tags

- Developer tools
	1) Network (HTTP request/response, js, css, images)
	2) Elements tab - To look at HTML tags/CSS of specific component
	3) Sources - We can browse our source code and debug by adding breakpoints
	4) console - We can try out few things programmatically
	
- HAR file (File used for troubleshooting API calls)
- Networking Throttling (We can try out our application on differnet network speed)

- Types of requests from browser:
	a) HTTP requets (Synchronous) - Blocking API calls (Waiting is there). Sequential execution
	b) AJAX request (Ayscnronous) - Non-Blocking API calls (No waiting). Parallel execution
	
	AJAX - Aysnchrounous JavaScript And XML
		- Ajax requests goes based on some events (e.g. Google search - whatever you type in background Ajax request goes)
		- Another example of Ajax - Email Registeration. If you use some email which is already used, you immediately
		get an error without submitting the form.

	inline -> id -> class -> Tag

While CSS rule should get executed is dervied based on concept called as
"CSS Specificity"

JSP, Servlets both are Server side programs.

- Servlet
	- This is Java class which inherits HttpServlet class. (This class comes from servlet-api.jar)
	- To define a Servlet we must define an URL (URL mapping)
	- We use Servlet when we have more Java code and less HTML
	
	
- JSP:
	- Java Server Pages. We add JSP with extension .jsp
	- Every JSP gets converted into a Servlet. (JSP Engine)
	- When we run JSP for first time, it will be slow. Later there is no difference.
	- It's preferred when we have more HTML and less Java
	
JSP Tags:
1) Scriptlet - Any java code we can write in scriptlet.

	<%
	
	%>

2) <%=   %> - Expression Tag
   Used to read/evaluate variable

3) <%! %> - Declaration Tag
	Used to define variables and functions
	
4) <%@ %> - Directive Tag

How to redirect to pages ?
